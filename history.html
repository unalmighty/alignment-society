      <h1>Our History</h1>
      <p>From humble beginnings to a global pre‑alignment powerhouse, the Alignment Society has always been ahead of the curve—often by accident. Here’s how we got to be so misaligned we had to create alignment as a service.</p>
      <h2>2015–2017: The Alignment Awakening</h2>
      <p>Founded in a co‑working space with unlimited cold brew, the Alignment Society began as a book club dedicated to reading slide decks. By aligning on meeting agendas, we quickly realised consensus could be monetised.</p>
      <h2>2018–2020: The Synergy Boom</h2>
      <p>As businesses everywhere chased digital transformations, we pivoted to orchestrating orchestration. Our Synergy Orchestration™ offering put us on the map, even if clients still weren’t sure what we actually did.</p>
      <h2>2021–present: The Pre‑Alignment Revolution</h2>
      <p>Today, we focus on pre‑alignment: aligning on how we will align on alignment. Our proprietary frameworks ensure no misalignment goes unfunded. Join us as we align toward the next frontier.</p>
